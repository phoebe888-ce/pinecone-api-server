your feedback with us. =F0=9F=92=9B We are truly sorry to hear that the len=
ses did not meet your expectations, and we completely understand how disapp=
ointing and uncomfortable that must have been.</p>
<p>Based on your description, it=E2=80=99s possible that the Black Sclera 2=
2mm lenses might be slightly too large for your eyes, which could cause the=
 shifting and blurriness you experienced. We also checked your order detail=
s and saw that you purchased two pairs of the Black Sclera 22mm Contacts (F=
ull Eye).</p>
<p>To better assist you, may we kindly ask:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Did you open and try on both pairs, and feel uncomfortable with both?</p=
>
</li>
<li>
<p>Or did you only open one pair so far?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If you have only opened one pair, would you mind sending us a photo of t=
he other pair that remains unopened in its original packaging? This would h=
elp us to better determine the next steps and provide you with the most sui=
table solution. =F0=9F=93=B8</p>
<p>As for the pair that you have already tried and found uncomfortable, we =
would love to offer you a $39.95 coupon as a goodwill gesture. With this, y=
ou can try a smaller size, such as our 17mm lenses, which may fit your eyes=
 more comfortably. =F0=9F=8C=9F Please let us know if you would like to pro=
ceed with this option.</p>
<p>This is our proposed solution for the pair you have worn. Once we receiv=
e your reply regarding the second pair, we=E2=80=99ll be happy to discuss t=
he next steps for that one as well.</p>
<p>We truly appreciate your understanding and patience, and we=E2=80=99re c=
ommitted to helping you find a lens that you love and feel comfortable wear=
ing. =F0=9F=92=95 Looking forward to hearing from you soon!</p>Best regards=

<p>Thank you so much for sharing your experience with us. First and foremos=

 been to not receive your lenses in time, especially when you had a specifi=

convenience this caused. =F0=9F=99=8F</p>
<p>While we always strive to process and ship orders as quickly as possible=

our filming date.</p>
<p>We=E2=80=99re very grateful to hear that you still received compliments =
on the lenses from your team, and that you were happy with the quality and =
look =E2=80=94 that truly means a lot to us. =F0=9F=92=96</p>
<p>As a gesture of goodwill, we would love to offer you a <b>$15 </b>coupon=

<p>If you=E2=80=99re open to it, we would also be so thankful if you could =
consider removing the review from Trustpilot, as even a small change can go=
 a long way in supporting our small business. If you do decide to remove it=

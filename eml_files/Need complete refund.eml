Dear Katrina,

Thank you so much for your prompt reply and for letting us know. =F0=9F=92=
=9B

 eyes =E2=80=94
your comfort and satisfaction are very important to us, and we absolutely
want to assist you properly. =F0=9F=99=8F

To help us locate your order and understand the situation more accurately,
may I kindly ask you to confirm your order number? We carefully checked our
system, but we were unable to find an order that matches both the lens

Once we have your order number, we=E2=80=99ll be able to review everything =
in

ok

Wendy from MocoQueen

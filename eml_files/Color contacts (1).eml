Dear Vod,

Thank you so much for your message! =F0=9F=98=8A

We truly appreciate your interest in picking up lenses in person. While our
warehouse is indeed located in California, I=E2=80=99m very sorry to let yo=
u know
that we do not offer a physical storefront or in-person pickup service at
this time =E2=80=94 all of our orders are processed and shipped directly fr=
om our
facility.

However, we do offer fast shipping options, and since you're located in
Pasadena, CA (91104), delivery typically takes just a few business days
once the order is dispatched. If you need help placing an order or choosing
the right lenses, we=E2=80=99re always here to assist! =F0=9F=92=9B
Our shipping details at this time are as follows=EF=BC=9A

Order Processing: 1 Business Day
USPS Standard Delivery Time (US): 3 - 5 business days (Free)
USPS Priority Delivery Time (US): 2 - 3 business days=EF=BC=88$7.95=EF=BC=
=89
UPS Next Day Air (US): 1 - 2 business days($46.95)

Hope it will help you.

Best regards,
Wendy from MocoQueen

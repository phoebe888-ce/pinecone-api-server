Dear Adunola,

Thank you so much for your reply, and I completely understand your
preference for a refund. =F0=9F=92=96

After reviewing your order details, I=E2=80=99d like to kindly let you know=
 that
since your order was placed using a discount code, we=E2=80=99re currently =
unable
to process a *partial refund* for just one pair of lenses. In this case,
the only available option would be to cancel *all of the lenses* in your
order and issue a full refund for the contact lens portion.

However, if you=E2=80=99re still interested in red-colored lenses, we=E2=80=
=99d love to
suggest the *Red Brown Zwei Costume Contacts (Rx)* as a great alternative!
=F0=9F=8E=AF
This style is also very popular and receives great feedback from customers.
If you=E2=80=99d like to consider it as a replacement, we=E2=80=99d be happ=
y to arrange
that for you right away.

Please let us know how you=E2=80=99d like to proceed=E2=80=94whether you=E2=
=80=99d prefer to choose
a replacement pair or cancel all the lenses for a refund. We=E2=80=99re her=
e to
help and want to make sure you=E2=80=99re fully satisfied with your experie=
nce. =F0=9F=98=8A

Thank you again for your time and understanding!
Best regards,
Wendy from MocoQueen

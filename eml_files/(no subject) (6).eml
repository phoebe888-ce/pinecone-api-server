Dear Arii,

Thank you for bringing this matter to our attention, and we sincerely
apologize for the inconvenience caused by the issue you have experienced.

In order to start the replacement process, could you please provide us with
a photo of the ripped contacts (in the blister ) you received? This will
help us better understand the issue and proceed with the appropriate
solution.

Thank you for your patience and understanding, and we look forward to
hearing back from you.

Best regards,
Wendy from MocoQueen

Dear Micaiah,

Thank you so much for your prompt response! =F0=9F=98=8A

We completely understand your preference for a refund. Regarding the
returned package, we truly regret the inconvenience caused. Since the
package was sent back to our warehouse due to an address issue, we have
incurred both warehouse handling fees and shipping costs. To process a
refund, we would need to deduct the original shipping fee and a $3 handling
fee per pair of lenses from the order total. This means the final refund
amount would be *$23.95*.

However, we also want to make this right for you. The coupon we originally
provided is valid for three months, and as a goodwill gesture, we would be
happy to *increase the coupon value to $39.95*. You can use it anytime
within the next three months to purchase any lenses of your choice.

Please let us know your thoughts, and we=E2=80=99ll proceed accordingly. Yo=
ur
satisfaction is very important to us, and we=E2=80=99re here to support you=
! =F0=9F=92=96
Best regards,
Wendy from MocoQueen

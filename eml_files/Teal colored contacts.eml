Dear Ashley,

Thank you so much for your message, and I'm truly sorry to hear about the
delay with your order. I completely understand your frustration, especially
since you were expecting the contacts in time for this weekend. Please
allow me to explain the current situation and offer our sincerest
apologies. =F0=9F=99=8F

Your order *#135360* was placed on *May 18*, and our warehouse shipped it
out on the next business day after receiving your order, which was *May 19*=
.
According to the latest USPS tracking update, the estimated delivery date
is currently *May 28*.

We=E2=80=99ve already contacted USPS to expedite the shipment process on yo=
ur
behalf. However, their response indicated that due to *severe weather
conditions*, many packages across the country are experiencing delays.
Here's the update we received:

*"Alert: Severe weather moving from the Central U.S. through the Eastern
U.S. and the Great Lakes regions in the U.S. may delay final delivery of
your mail and packages."*

We're truly sorry for this inconvenience. Unfortunately, delays due to
weather are beyond our control, and we understand how disappointing this
must be, especially since the timing was important to you.

If you still receive the package later than the expected *3=E2=80=935 busin=
ess day*
delivery window you selected, please don=E2=80=99t hesitate to reach out to=
 us
again. We would be happy to offer you a *15% off coupon* as a gesture of
goodwill and apology for the inconvenience caused.

Thank you so much for your understanding and patience. If there=E2=80=99s a=
nything
else we can assist you with in the meantime, we=E2=80=99re always here to h=
elp.

Warmest regards,
Wendy from MocoQueen

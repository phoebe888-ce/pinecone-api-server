Dear Hurricane,

Thank you so much for reaching out to us. I truly understand your concern,
and I=E2=80=99m really sorry that the lack of updates has caused you so muc=
h worry.
Please know that we take your order seriously and are here to help.

We=E2=80=99ve already contacted our warehouse to confirm the status of your
shipment, and I can assure you that your package has indeed been shipped
out. However, due to recent severe weather conditions, many shipments =E2=
=80=94
including yours =E2=80=94 are experiencing unexpected delays and slower tra=
cking
updates from the carrier.

We completely understand how frustrating this must be, especially when
you're eagerly waiting for your package. =F0=9F=98=94 Based on our experien=
ce, the
tracking should update within the next *two business days*, so we kindly
ask for just a bit more patience while your package makes its way to you.

We're truly sorry for the inconvenience this has caused and appreciate your
understanding during this time. Please rest assured that we=E2=80=99re keep=
ing a
close eye on your order and will continue to monitor it closely.

If there=E2=80=99s anything else we can do to assist in the meantime, pleas=
e don=E2=80=99t
hesitate to reach out. =F0=9F=92=9B

Warm regards,
Wendy from MocoQueen

Dear Micaiah,

Thank you so much for your kind response! =F0=9F=98=8A We really appreciate=
 your
understanding.

It seems there might have been a bit of a misunderstanding, so we=E2=80=99d=
 like to
clarify. The refund and coupon are two separate options, and we kindly ask
you to choose one of them.

   1.

   If you decide to cancel the order and receive a refund, we will process
   the refund amount of *$23.95* after deducting the shipping and handling
   fees.
   2.

   Alternatively, if you prefer to place a new order instead of requesting
   a refund, we can provide you with the upgraded *$39.95* coupon. You can
   use this coupon for any new purchase within the next three months.

Please let us know which option works best for you, and we will proceed
accordingly. Your satisfaction is our priority, and we are here to support
you! =F0=9F=92=96

Looking forward to your reply.

Best regards,
Wendy from MocoQueen

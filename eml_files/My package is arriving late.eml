Dear Bruh,

Thank you so much for reaching out. I=E2=80=99m truly sorry to hear about t=
he delay
with your order, and I completely understand how disappointing and
frustrating this must be =E2=80=94 especially when the timing was so import=
ant for
you =F0=9F=98=94.

We=E2=80=99ve carefully reviewed your order details, and here=E2=80=99s wha=
t we found:

Your order #135134 was placed on May 16th. As part of our standard process,
our warehouse requires one full business day for handling and packing once
an order is received. Your package was shipped out on the next business
day, May 19th.

You selected USPS Free 3=E2=80=935 Business Days shipping, and under normal
conditions, your package would be expected to arrive within that timeframe.
However, according to the latest USPS tracking update, your estimated
delivery date is now May 27th, which we understand is outside of the
expected delivery window.

After contacting USPS for clarification, we were informed that severe
weather conditions are currently affecting delivery times. The official
alert reads:

=E2=80=9CSEVERE WEATHER MOVING FROM THE CENTRAL U.S. THROUGH THE EASTERN U.=
S. AND
THE GREAT LAKES REGIONS IN THE U.S. MAY DELAY FINAL DELIVERY OF YOUR MAIL
AND PACKAGES.=E2=80=9D

Unfortunately, this kind of weather-related delay is beyond our control,
and we=E2=80=99re truly sorry for the inconvenience it has caused you. That=
 said,
shipping estimates are not always exact =E2=80=94 there is still a possibil=
ity your
package may arrive sooner than projected, and we=E2=80=99re sincerely hopin=
g it
reaches you quickly =F0=9F=99=8F.

In the meantime, if you do receive your order later than 5 business days
after the shipping date (after May 24th), please don=E2=80=99t hesitate to =
contact
us again. We would be more than happy to provide you with a 15% off coupon
as a gesture of our sincere apology and to hopefully make up for this
inconvenience in some small way.

Again, I deeply apologize for the unexpected delay and truly appreciate
your patience and understanding. If there=E2=80=99s anything else we can do=
 to
support you, please let us know =E2=80=94 we=E2=80=99re always here to help=
 =F0=9F=92=96.

Warmest regards,
Wendy from MocoQueen

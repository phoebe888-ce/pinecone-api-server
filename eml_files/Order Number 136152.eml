In the U.S., even plano (non-prescription) contact lenses do require a vali=

<p>The reason we reached out is because the prescription you provided indic=

 =E2=80=94 is a <strong>non-prescription</strong> (plano) lens and unfortun=
ately does not come in a corrective version.</p>
<p>If you do need the lenses in <strong>-2.00</strong>, we kindly suggest s=
witching to one of our prescription styles instead.=C2=A0</p>
<p>On the other hand, if your eye care provider has confirmed that it&#39;s=

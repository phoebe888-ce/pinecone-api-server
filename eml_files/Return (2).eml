Hello Jade,

Thank you for reaching out to us. We understand that the 22mm sclera lens
may be a bit challenging to wear due to its larger diameter and base curve
compared to the 17mm and 14mm lenses.

To assist you with this, we have provided a video link below that
demonstrates how to wear the 22mm sclera lens. We hope that this will be
helpful to you:

*If you have any other questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to
contact us. We're always here to assist you.*

Best regards,
Wendy from MocoQueen

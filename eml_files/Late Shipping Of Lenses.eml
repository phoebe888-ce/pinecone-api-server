Dear LUNA,

Thank you for reaching out regarding your order. I apologize for the
inconvenience caused by the delay in your shipment.

We have reviewed your order #136261, which was placed on 5/24. As per our
policy, our warehouse arranges shipments on the first business day after
receiving an order. Therefore, your order was shipped on 5/26.

Currently, the estimated delivery date on USPS website is 5/31, which is
indeed later than the typical delivery time for USPS Priority shipping. We
are very sorry for this delay and any inconvenience it has caused.

We have contacted USPS to expedite the shipping process for your package.
=F0=9F=A4=9ESometimes the actual delivery time can be earlier than the esti=
mated date
on the website, so we kindly ask for your patience.

Because Monday is a holiday and USPS is closed, we arranged for packaging
and shipment as soon as we received the order, but USPS actually started
shipping on 5/27. This will affect the actual delivery of your package.

If your package does not arrive until 5/31, please contact us again, and we
will compensate you with a $10 coupon for the inconvenience.

Thank you for your understanding and patience.

Best regards,
Wendy from MocoQueen

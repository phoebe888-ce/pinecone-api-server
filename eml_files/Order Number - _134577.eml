Dear Rita,

I hope you=E2=80=99re doing well! =F0=9F=92=96

Yellow Contact Lenses (Rx)* you selected is currently out of stock, and we
would love to help you choose a suitable replacement.

If you could take a moment to browse our shop and select another pair of
lenses, please share the link with us, and we=E2=80=99ll promptly notify ou=
r
warehouse to arrange the replacement and shipping.

We truly value your understanding and patience, and we want to make this
process as smooth as possible for you. If you have any questions or need
assistance with selecting an alternative, please feel free to let us know!
=F0=9F=98=8A

Looking forward to your reply.

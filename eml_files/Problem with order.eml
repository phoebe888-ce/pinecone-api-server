Dear Millie,

We apologize for the inconvenience you're experiencing with one of our
contact lenses. We're here to help resolve the issue.

To address this concern, we recommend soaking your lenses in the
specialized contact lens care solution for a full 24 hours. Afterward,
please rinse and gently scrub your lenses. This process often helps in
cases like yours.

Please give this a try, and if the problem persists or if you have any
further questions, don't hesitate to reach out to us. We are here to assist
you.

Thank you for choosing our products, and we appreciate your patience.

Best regards,
Wendy from MocoQueen

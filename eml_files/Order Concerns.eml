Hi Jon,

Thank you so much for reaching out, and I=E2=80=99m really sorry to hear ab=
out the
discomfort you experienced. =F0=9F=98=94 I=E2=80=99m glad to hear you follo=
wed the
recommended soaking steps before wearing the lenses!

May I ask =E2=80=94 is this your *first time wearing contact lenses*? If so=
, it's
completely normal to experience some dryness or sensitivity in the
beginning. For new wearers, we usually recommend *starting with shorter
wear times*, such as 1=E2=80=932 hours, and then gradually increasing the d=
uration
each day as your eyes adjust to the lenses. =F0=9F=98=8A

Here are a few helpful tips to ensure a more comfortable wearing experience=
:

   -

   Make sure your hands are clean and dry before handling the lenses.
   -

   Always soak the lenses in fresh multi-purpose contact lens solution for
   at least 6=E2=80=938 hours before first use.
   -

   Avoid wearing lenses in dry or windy environments for too long,
   especially indoors with strong air conditioning (like at convention
   centers).
   -

   You can use *re-wetting eye drops* (compatible with contact lenses)
   throughout the day to help with dryness.
   -

   Never wear the lenses longer than the recommended daily limit (usually
   no more than 8 hours), especially for costume lenses.

It=E2=80=99s great that you=E2=80=99ve placed them back in solution =E2=80=
=94 give your eyes a
little rest, and when you feel ready, you can try wearing them again for a
short period to see how they feel. If you continue to experience
discomfort, please let us know and we=E2=80=99ll be happy to assist further=
.

We=E2=80=99re always here to help, and we truly appreciate you giving us a =
try! =F0=9F=92=9B

Warm regards,
Wendy from MocoQuee

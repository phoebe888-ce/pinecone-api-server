Dear Nina,

Thank you for reaching out regarding your order. I apologize for the
inconvenience caused by the delay in your shipment.

We have reviewed your order #133316, which was placed on 5/4. As per our
policy, our warehouse arranges shipments on the first business day after
receiving an order. Therefore, your order was shipped on 5/5.

Currently, the estimated delivery date on USPS website is 5/12, which is
indeed later than the typical delivery time for USPS Priority shipping. We
are very sorry for this delay and any inconvenience it has caused.

We have contacted USPS to expedite the shipping process for your package.
=F0=9F=A4=9ESometimes the actual delivery time can be earlier than the esti=
mated date
on the website, so we kindly ask for your patience.

Please contact us again after receiving the package, and we will give you a
10% OFF coupon to compensate for the inconvenience.

If you do not want to keep the order and want to start the return process,
please send us a photo of the unopened package, and we will guide you to
start the return process after receiving it.

Thank you for your understanding and patience.

Best regards,
Wendy from MocoQueen

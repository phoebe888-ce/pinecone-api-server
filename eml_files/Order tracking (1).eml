Dear Sabrina,

You're very welcome! =F0=9F=98=8A And no worries at all =E2=80=94 mistakes =
like that happen
to the best of us. Thank you for letting us know!

We=E2=80=99ve noted the correct email now as *sabrinaravenwood@gmail.com*, =
but
since the shipping confirmation has already been sent to the original
address, just be sure to double-check next time during checkout so you
won=E2=80=99t miss any future updates =E2=9C=A8

If you need anything else or have any other questions, feel free to reach
out anytime. We=E2=80=99re always happy to help!

Warmest regards,

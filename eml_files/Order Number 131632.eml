Dear Jonathan,

I hope you=E2=80=99re doing well! =F0=9F=98=8A

I just wanted to kindly follow up regarding the message we sent earlier. We
truly value your feedback and want to make sure that your concerns are
properly addressed.

We wanted to check if you had a chance to consider our suggestion of trying
the *17mm lenses* as a more comfortable alternative. Your satisfaction is
extremely important to us, and we genuinely hope to find a solution that
works for you.

If you are still willing to accept the offered *$39.95 coupon*, just let us
know, and we will send it to you right away. Your support and understanding
mean a lot to us, and we truly appreciate the opportunity to make this
right.

Looking forward to hearing from you!

Best regards,
Wendy from MocoQueen

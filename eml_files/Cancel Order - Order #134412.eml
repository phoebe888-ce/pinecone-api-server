Dear Amanda,

Thank you so much for getting back to us, and we completely understand! =F0=
=9F=92=96

If you have a specific =E2=80=9Ccyborg=E2=80=9D-inspired look in mind, we=
=E2=80=99d love to help
you find something that matches your vision. If possible, could you please
send us a reference photo or a brief description of the style you're
looking for? That would really help us narrow down the best options
available in your -3.50 prescription.

We truly want you to be thrilled with your lenses, so if there's something
that even comes close to what you=E2=80=99re looking for, we=E2=80=99ll do =
our very best to
help you find it =F0=9F=A5=B0

Looking forward to hearing from you soon, and thank you again for giving us
the opportunity to assist!

Warmest regards,
Wendy from MocoQueen
